        <li>Add cubed potatoes, toss to coat, and saute for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return bacon to the pan, and add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour, and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>       
        <li>Whisk in the heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro.</li>
        <li>Bring the cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened.</li>
        <li>Stir the cream mixture into the potato mixture.</li>
        <li>Puree about 1/2 the soup, and return to the pan. Adjust seasonings to taste.</li>
