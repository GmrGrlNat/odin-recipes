    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>So, this recipe is supposedly a copycat version of Panera's. Is it an accurate replication? No idea, but it does look like a good soup. Plus, the writer said it was cheaper, so let's dive in!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1/2 an onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chopped broccoli florets</li>
        <li>1 cup matchstick-cut carrots</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk the 1/4 cup of melted butter and the flour together in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Continue to whisk and cook, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of milk if necessary to keep the flour from burning, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour milk into flour mixture while whisking constantly. Stir chicken stock into milk mixture. Bring to a simmer, and cook until mixture is thickened, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add broccoli, carrots, sauteed onion, and celery. Simmer until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir in cheddar cheese until melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>And there you have it! A wonderful and warm broccoli cheddar soup! Enjoy!!</p>
